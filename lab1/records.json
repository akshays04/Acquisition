Shami whacked it with a lot of timing.. all eyes were aimed at the stands to see where it was landing, but no one saw Moeen setting himself up near the boundary.. he keeps his calm, avoids the rope and gobbles it up <strong>153/10</strong><br/>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"2%\">\u00a0</td>\n<td class=\"bowler-name\"><a class=\"playerName\" href=\"/ci/content/player/247235.html\" target=\"\" title=\"view the player profile for Chris Woakes\">CR Woakes</a></td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>5.00</td>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td class=\"td-extra\">(1w)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"dismissal-detail\">\n<td width=\"2%\"></td>\n<td colspan=\"7\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"2%\">\u00a0</td>\n<td class=\"bowler-name\"><a class=\"playerName\" href=\"/ci/content/player/10617.html\" target=\"\" title=\"view the player profile for Stuart Broad\">SCJ Broad</a></td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>33</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>4.71</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td class=\"td-extra\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"dismissal-detail\">\n<td width=\"2%\"></td>\n<td colspan=\"7\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td-icon-expand-collapse\"><img alt=\"View wickets\" name=\"inningsBowl1.4\" src=\"http://i.imgci.com/espncricinfo/scorecard/icon_plus_full-scorecard.jpg\" title=\"View wickets\"/></td>\n<td class=\"bowler-name\"><a class=\"playerName\" href=\"/ci/content/player/210283.html\" target=\"\" title=\"view the player profile for Steven Finn\">ST Finn</a></td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>33</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4.12</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td class=\"td-extra\">(1nb, 1w)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"dismissal-detail\">\n<td width=\"2%\"></td>\n<td colspan=\"7\"> <strong>14.3</strong> to <strong>Rahane</strong>, 82.5 mph, he has thrown it away! Poor shot from Rahane. Fifth time Rahane dismissed by Finn. He comes down the pitch and looks to whack the back of length delivery over midwicket but the extra bounce means it hits the splice of the bot and balloons towards mid-on where the fielder backpedals and takes an easy catch <strong>57/2</strong><br/>\n<strong>16.4</strong> to <strong>Kohli</strong>, 83.5 mph, he is gone! The extra bounce has done him here. He looks to dab the back of length delivery towards third man but this rises up and catches the shoulder of the bat... It flies high and Buttler takes a good catch behind the stumps. That is an action replay of Kohli's dismissal in the first innings of the Brisbane Test <strong>64/3</strong><br/>\n<strong>18.6</strong> to <strong>Rayudu</strong>, 81.4 mph, Numero tres for Finn!! This is not too different from how Kohli got out.. back of length, rising outside off, Rayudu looks to guide it to third man but gets a thick edge to the keeper. It's that extra bounce again. Indian batsmen being swallowed at the Gabbatoir <strong>67/5</strong><br/>\n<strong>36.1</strong> to <strong>Dhoni</strong>, 80.5 mph, gets his man! Finn has four now. Dhoni couldn't add on after that chance. It's a slower bounce on the leg stump line, Dhoni goes for the hook but feathers it to the keeper <strong>137/6</strong><br/>\n<strong>36.2</strong> to <strong>Patel</strong>, 84.6 mph, he has got his five-for! Excellent bowling from round the stump. This one is fuller and comes in a touch to beat the inside edge.. goes through the gap and hits the top of off. Happy birthday Axar. It's his second <i>golden</i> duck in two games <strong>137/7</strong><br/>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td-icon-expand-collapse\"><img alt=\"View wicket\" name=\"inningsBowl1.5\" src=\"http://i.imgci.com/espncricinfo/scorecard/icon_plus_full-scorecard.jpg\" title=\"View wicket\"/></td>\n<td class=\"bowler-name\"><a class=\"playerName\" href=\"/ci/content/player/8917.html\" target=\"\" title=\"view the player profile for Moeen Ali\">MM Ali</a></td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>31</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>3.44</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td class=\"td-extra\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"dismissal-detail\">\n<td width=\"2%\"></td>\n<td colspan=\"7\"> <strong>17.2</strong> to <strong>Raina</strong>, 55.4 mph, Moeen creates magic again!

Ruled not out by the umpire initially, so the umpire wants to have a closer look. Replays look as though he might be just out before both the bails were dislodged, as it looks like presently only one of the bails were removed before Taylor got his foot back across the line.

Was looking to shimmy down the track before seeing the fuller length, before deciding to readjust the stroke to get it away down leg. He is struck right in line of the stumps as he falls over a touch. He takes a couple of steps down to look behind him before he sees the umpire raise the finger after Boult's initial appeal. Wants a <b>review</b> right away, but this looked dead on, with replays confirming that this was indeed going on to hit the stumps. Sangakkara has to go, and with that possibly the hopes of many Sri Lankans, both at the ground and back home <strong>129/4</strong><br/>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td-icon-expand-collapse\"><img alt=\"View wickets\" name=\"inningsBowl2.3\" src=\"http://i.imgci.com/espncricinfo/scorecard/icon_plus_full-scorecard.jpg\" title=\"View wickets\"/></td>\n<td class=\"bowler-name\"><a class=\"playerName\" href=\"/ci/content/player/450860.html\" target=\"\" title=\"view the player profile for Adam Milne\">AF Milne</a></td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>56</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5.60</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td class=\"td-extra\">(1nb, 3w)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"dismissal-detail\">\n<td width=\"2%\"></td>\n<td colspan=\"7\"> <strong>31.3</strong> to <strong>Karunaratne</strong>, 85.5 mph, decides to operate round the wicket now to Dimuth, and the plan comes off as he gets Dimuth to play all around this length delivery shaping in with the angle, striking the top of off stump.

He takes it one-handed, but in mid-air he gets it right hand around and nearly transfers it from left to right. The right hand has come around because the ball is slipping out. The right glove pushes it back into the left. This is top keeping. Afghanistan have taken their first World Cup wicket, and they have built dot by dot to it.

Beats the outside edge to hit the top of off stump. That is a peach. Angling in but swinging away. Lands around off. Bell has been in this mode where he is trying to stay beside the line to open up the off side. So he is not quite behind the line of this, and the ball swings to beat his bat. Off stump, bu-bye <strong>18/1</strong><br/>\n<strong>6.2</strong> to <strong>Ali</strong>, 84.5 mph, that's the one-two. Bowl a bouncer to those who don't like bouncers. Have them expecting another one and thus staying back. Slip in a full one. Take the edge or hit the the stumps. Southee has hit the off stump here. This has swung back in towards the base of the off stump and squeezes under it. Apart from staying back he has played woefully down the wrong line <strong>36/2</strong><br/>\n<strong>26.2</strong> to <strong>Taylor</strong>, 83.3 mph, what captaincy, what bowling. McCullum calls his strike bowler. Look, get me a wicket. Southee bowls one wide outswinger. That draws an appeal. And now he bowls an outswinging yorker that beats the outside edge of the new batsman and pings back the off stump. What a joy to watch the aggressive approach and the execution thereof by New Zealand <strong>104/5</strong><br/>\n<strong>28.1</strong> to <strong>Buttler</strong>, 83.6 mph, lovely outswing bowling. Southee has a four-for. This is on a length, not too wide, you can't keep leaving them alone all day long in ODIs. Buttler pushes at it, Southee gets enough movement away to take the edge and England are six down <strong>108/6</strong><br/>\n<strong>28.4</strong> to <strong>Woakes</strong>, 86.2 mph, Southee. Unplayable Southee. Has a Michelle now. Four of them have been bowled to outswingers that have hit the off stump. That's beautiful. Outswingers hitting the top of off. Too good for a No. 8. Woakes' only mistake here is, he is not forward. Southee loves it. Gives him the space to let this outswinger drop and then move past the outside edge to hit the top of off. Nothing wrong in the pitch here. Just high-quality swing bowling and aggressive captaincy <strong>110/7</strong><br/>\n<strong>30.4</strong> to <strong>Broad</strong>, 82.0 mph, Southee has six. Broad needs talking to. Ordinary attitude to batting. Running away and hoping for the best. He has moved away from leg, and just put his bat there. The leading edge to the full ball carried to mid-off where Vettori takes a two-hander to his left <strong>116/8</strong><br/>\n<strong>32.3</strong> to <strong>Finn</strong>, 84.1 mph, Seven for Southee. This is lovely stuff. Just floats in an outswinger outside off, Finn follows it, edges it to Taylor at first slip. Best figures for a NZer in a WC match.

He is early into the shot but is quite forceful, which means this goes in the air and travels a long way. The trouble is, it seems it straight enough of long-on.

Taylor tried a cross-batted shot for the length delivery just around off, the ball swung in and went right through the gate to rattle the off stump.

Elliott left a big gap between bat and pad for the straight delivery that pitched around off and came in to rattle middle stump, he didn't have much footwork either and pushed only tentatively at the ball. Happens on the first ball <strong>79/4</strong><br/>\n<strong>20.6</strong> to <strong>Ronchi</strong>, 87.8 mph, peach of a delivery from Starc and that deserves a wicket!

Easy catch for the fielder.

They are checking for the catch now, Anderson waiting at the boundary. Cummins was down on his knees as the ball was dipping on him, replays show a part of the ball was out of his hands and they aren't clear enough to say if the ball hit the ground for sure or not.

Goes up straightaway for the appeal, which the umpire corroborates soon after. Dilshan wants the <b>review</b> though after consulting with Sangakkara at the other end. It was another back-of-the-hand slower ball which definitely hit in line as there are four reds across the screen. Dilshan has to go, much to the delight of the Sydney crowd. Has been an excellent firestarter of a knock to get Sri Lanka's chase off on the best possible foot <strong>135/2</strong><br/>\n<strong>33.5</strong> to <strong>Sangakkara</strong>, 71.8 mph, and that may very well be game for Sri Lanka as Kumar finally departs from the middle after looking to go after this Faulkner delivery, which was slipped in at a fuller length, as he ends up slicing over to the man at deep cover, who this time is able to get under it comfortably. There was some hesitation on the part of the fourth umpire to give this as replays show Faulkner just about, and I mean just about, got his foot behind the line. Really was touch and go there, but because a conclusive decision could not be reached, Sangakkara has to go. Has been a fine effort in this stirring chase so far <strong>201/4</strong><br/>\n<strong>45.2</strong> to <strong>Tharanga</strong>, 70.4 mph, Faulkner strikes right away for his captain as Tharanga, Sri Lanka's last recognised batsman, has to go after carting this back of a length straight to the man stationed at cow corner, who is able to get under it quite comfortably <strong>307/8</strong><br/>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table><table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"98%\">\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" height=\"10\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"30%\">\u00a0</td>\n<td width=\"70%\"><table align=\"right\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"135\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"53\"><a href=\"/ci/engine/match/656461.html?wrappertype=print;view=scorecard;\" target=\"_top\"><img align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Print this page\" border=\"0\" height=\"20\" src=\"http://i.imgci.com/espncricinfo/ciPhoto_print-bttn.jpg\" title=\"Print this page\" width=\"53\"/></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" height=\"10\"></td>\n</tr>\n</table><table align=\"right\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"135\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\" width=\"53\"><a href=\"/ci/engine/match/656461.html?wrappertype=print;view=scorecard;\" target=\"_top\"><img align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Print this page\" border=\"0\" height=\"20\" src=\"http://i.imgci.com/espncricinfo/ciPhoto_print-bttn.jpg\" title=\"Print this page\" width=\"53\"/></a></td>\n</tr>\n</table>", "location": "Sydney", "date": "Mar 8, 2015", "margin": "64 runs", "id": "ODI # 3629"}, {"scorecardLink": "http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/656463.html", "winner": "Bangladesh", "team1": "Bangladesh", "team2": "England", "scorecard": " <table class=\"batting-table innings\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr class=\"tr-heading\">\n<th>\u00a0</th>\n<th class=\"th-innings-heading\" colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\">Bangladesh innings   <span class=\"normal\"> (50 overs maximum)   </span> </th>\n<th class=\"th-r\" scope=\"col\" title=\"runs scored\">R</th>\n<th class=\"th-m\" scope=\"col\" title=\"minutes batted\">M</th>\n<th class=\"th-b\" scope=\"col\" title=\"balls faced\">B</th>\n<th class=\"th-4s\" scope=\"col\" title=\"boundary fours\">4s</th>\n<th class=\"th-6s\" scope=\"col\" title=\"boundary sixes\">6s</th>\n<th class=\"th-sr\" scope=\"col\" title=\"batting strike rate: runs scored per 100 balls faced\">SR</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td-icon-expand-collapse\"><img alt=\"View dismissal\" src=\"http://i.imgci.com/espncricinfo/scorecard/icon_plus_full-scorecard.jpg\" title=\"View dismissal\"/></td>\n<td class=\"batsman-name\"><a class=\"playerName\" href=\"/ci/content/player/56194.html\" target=\"\" title=\"view the player profile for Tamim Iqbal\">Tamim Iqbal</a> </td>\n<td class=\"dismissal-info\">c Root b Anderson\t\t<span class=\"clipper-popup-link\">\n<a class=\"link-video-clip\" data-assetname=\"evc_20150308_Bangladesh_vs_England_278422\" data-brightcoveurl=\"http://once.unicornmedia.com/now/od/auto/8d0cdec0-370f-4251-be8c-4af5e3588cc0/6ffb1a11-c953-4127-bd27-f2296fec5aa7/62c52d44-ee73-4ff2-9671-0ac8ea002bcf/content.once?UMADPARAMreferer=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/video_audio/846273.html\" data-duration=\"00:39\" data-embargodate=\"2015-03-09 03:43:27\" data-expirationdate=\"2015-06-29 04:00:00\" data-external_id=\"54fd16e1e4b0d7add8845f92\" data-headline=\"2.1 JM Anderson to Tamim Iqbal, out\" data-headlineshort=\"2.1 JM Anderson to Tamim Iqbal, out\" data-mezzaninepathimage=\"/media/motion/2015/0308/evc_20150308_Bangladesh_vs_England_278422/evc_20150308_Bangladesh_vs_England_278422.jpg\" data-thumbnail_path=\"/media/motion/2015/0308/evc_20150308_Bangladesh_vs_England_278422/evc_20150308_Bangladesh_vs_England_278422.jpg\" data-unicornurl=\"http://once.unicornmedia.com/now/od/auto/8d0cdec0-370f-4251-be8c-4af5e3588cc0/6ffb1a11-c953-4127-bd27-f2296fec5aa7/62c52d44-ee73-4ff2-9671-0ac8ea002bcf/content.once?UMADPARAMreferer=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/video_audio/846273.html\" href=\"#\"><img src=\"http://i.imgci.com/espncricinfo/scorecard/icon-vid-pop-up.png\"/></a>\n</span>\n</td>\n<td class=\"bold\">2</td>\n<td class=\"\">10</td>\n<td class=\"\">7</td>\n<td class=\"\">0</td>\n<td class=\"\">0</td>\n<td class=\"\">28.57</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"dismissal-detail\">\n<td width=\"2%\"></td>\n<td colspan=\"8\"> <b>2.1</b> 85.7 mph, Anderson is the man in Adelaide as he succeeds at once again finding the outside edge, this time of Tamim's bat as he pushed at this back of a length which shaped away.

Mahela can go back to his nap now as he departs with just 2 to his name <strong>244/3</strong><br/>\n<strong>36.5</strong> to <strong>Sangakkara</strong>, 78.8 mph, Sangakkara must have missed his buddy out there as he goes after this length delivery going across, with the left-hander out of his crease as he tried to slice this over point, but ends up feeding an edge to the keeper, who goes up for it instantaneously. Sangakkara exits the field after making both ODI and World Cup history. Surely he can't make it five now? Guess we will have to wait and see <strong>244/4</strong><br/>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td-icon-expand-collapse\"><img alt=\"View wickets\" name=\"inningsBowl1.4\" src=\"http://i.imgci.com/espncricinfo/scorecard/icon_plus_full-scorecard.jpg\" title=\"View wickets\"/></td>\n<td class=\"bowler-name\"><a class=\"playerName\" href=\"/ci/content/player/25490.html\" target=\"\" title=\"view the player profile for Richie Berrington\">RD Berrington</a></td>\n<td>6.1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>31</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5.02</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td class=\"td-extra\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"dismissal-detail\">\n<td width=\"2%\"></td>\n<td colspan=\"7\"> <strong>44.4</strong> to <strong>NLTC Perera</strong>, 76.7 mph, Sri Lanka falling away slightly here as Thisara, looking for the massive heave over midwicket, ends up finding the fielder on the boundary, who is able to take the catch <strong>328/7</strong><br/>\n<strong>46.5</strong> to <strong>Malinga</strong>, 68.9 mph, full, outside of off, as Malinga slices this one over cover, with the fielder able to get under it nicely.

Looks like it was Jadeja who had put in the fine work in the field <b>33/2</b><br/>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td-icon-expand-collapse\"><img alt=\"View dismissal\" src=\"http://i.imgci.com/espncricinfo/scorecard/icon_plus_full-scorecard.jpg\" title=\"View dismissal\"/></td>\n<td class=\"batsman-name\"><a class=\"playerName\" href=\"/ci/content/player/436677.html\" target=\"\" title=\"view the player profile for Soumya Sarkar\">Soumya Sarkar</a> </td>\n<td class=\"dismissal-info\">c \u2020Dhoni b Mohammed Shami\t\t<span class=\"clipper-popup-link\">\n<a class=\"link-video-clip\" data-assetname=\"evc_20150319_India_vs_Bangladesh_285483\" data-brightcoveurl=\"http://once.unicornmedia.com/now/od/auto/8d0cdec0-370f-4251-be8c-4af5e3588cc0/6ffb1a11-c953-4127-bd27-f2296fec5aa7/c48a3346-79a7-49a0-b105-8debc0c32f7d/content.once?UMADPARAMreferer=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/video_audio/852571.html\" data-duration=\"00:47\" data-embargodate=\"2015-03-19 09:46:42\" data-expirationdate=\"2015-06-29 04:00:00\" data-external_id=\"550a9b04e4b0b47df919d587\" data-headline=\"20.4 Mohammed Shami to Soumya Sarkar, out\" data-headlineshort=\"20.4 Mohammed Shami to Soumya Sarkar, out\" data-mezzaninepathimage=\"/media/motion/2015/0319/evc_20150319_India_vs_Bangladesh_285483/evc_20150319_India_vs_Bangladesh_285483.jpg\" data-thumbnail_path=\"/media/motion/2015/0319/evc_20150319_India_vs_Bangladesh_285483/evc_20150319_India_vs_Bangladesh_285483.jpg\" data-unicornurl=\"http://once.unicornmedia.com/now/od/auto/8d0cdec0-370f-4251-be8c-4af5e3588cc0/6ffb1a11-c953-4127-bd27-f2296fec5aa7/c48a3346-79a7-49a0-b105-8debc0c32f7d/content.once?UMADPARAMreferer=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/video_audio/852571.html\" href=\"#\"><img src=\"http://i.imgci.com/espncricinfo/scorecard/icon-vid-pop-up.png\"/></a>\n</span>\n</td>\n<td class=\"bold\">29</td>\n<td class=\"\">59</td>\n<td class=\"\">43</td>\n<td class=\"\">3</td>\n<td class=\"\">1</td>\n<td class=\"\">67.44</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"dismissal-detail\">\n<td width=\"2%\"></td>\n<td colspan=\"8\"> <b>20.4</b> 87.0 mph, how is that for a catch?! it's a rare sight to see Dhoni diving, but he has here and has plucked a one-handed screamer!

Tamim is not convinced though as he wants the umpires to review whether this one indeed carried cleanly to the Indian captain. Shows the ball went in cleanly upon second viewing. Tamim has to go <strong>33/1</strong><br/>\n<strong>35.1</strong> to <strong>Mushfiqur Rahim</strong>, 87.6 mph, it had to happen! Beware the batting Powerplay. The short ball skids onto him far too quickly for his pull, takes a leading edge while he was only midway through the stroke and simply shot straight up. Dhoni says it's mine, spreads his arms out to make sure everyone knew it and pouches it cleanly. <strong>139/6</strong><br/>\n<strong>44.4</strong> to <strong>Rubel Hossain</strong>, 86.2 mph, short ball consumes Rubel as Kohli shakes his head, almost sadly. Too quick for him, too straight for him to free the arms and the top edge is safely pouched at square leg <strong>193/9</strong><br/>\n<strong>44.6</strong> to <strong>Sabbir Rahman</strong>, 85.6 mph, nearly popped out, but the second grab does it. India are into the  semi-finals with the 100th win under MS Dhoni. Had to be a short ball to sign things off and the top-edged pull flies to long leg. The fielder got under it, but might have been a touch nervous. Hard hands meant he nearly spilled it, but he was alert enough to grab the rebound <strong>193/10</strong><br/>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td-icon-expand-collapse\"><img alt=\"View wickets\" name=\"inningsBowl2.2\" src=\"http://i.imgci.com/espncricinfo/scorecard/icon_plus_full-scorecard.jpg\" title=\"View wickets\"/></td>\n<td class=\"bowler-name\"><a class=\"playerName\" href=\"/ci/content/player/481896.html\" target=\"\" title=\"view the player profile for Mohammed Shami\">Mohammed Shami</a></td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>37</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4.62</td>\n<td>34</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td class=\"td-extra\">(4w)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"dismissal-detail\">\n<td width=\"2%\"></td>\n<td colspan=\"7\"> <strong>16.6</strong> to <strong>Mahmudullah</strong>, 86.3 mph, it was a short ball, it was coming in at Mahmudullah who goes for an instinctive pull. But it seems to spew off the top edge. Yet it was travelling and seemed to lob the fielder at long leg, but Dhawan has pulled off a magnificent juggling act. Admittedly the ball popped out of his hands as he went for a reverse-cup catch. But he regrouped quickly, took the second attempt but that was when his left leg was about an inch away from disturbing the rope. He knew he has to toss the ball back into the field of play. Did that so very well and then wandered back in to pick up the catch <strong>73/3</strong><br/>\n<strong>20.4</strong> to <strong>Soumya Sarkar</strong>, 87.0 mph, how is that for a catch?! it's a rare sight to see Dhoni diving, but he has here and has plucked a one-handed screamer! Shami goes for another short ball bowled cross-seam, Sarkar looks for an encore of the ramp, but realises this is the slower bouncer. He does't have to pace to work with, he committed to the stroke too early and the ball simply runs off the open face. Dhoni moved to his left, dived full length and the ball somehow manages to find a seat in his left glove <strong>90/4</strong><br/>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"td-icon-expand-collapse\"><img alt=\"View wicket\" name=\"inningsBowl2.3\" src=\"http://i.imgci.com/espncricinfo/scorecard/icon_plus_full-scorecard.jpg\" title=\"View wicket\"/></td>\n<td class=\"bowler-name\"><a class=\"playerName\" href=\"/ci/content/player/537119.html\" target=\"\" title=\"view the player profile for Mohit Sharma\">MM Sharma</a></td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>36</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5.14</td>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td class=\"td-extra\">(1w)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"dismissal-detail\">\n<td width=\"2%\"></td>\n<td colspan=\"7\"> <strong>43.6</strong> to <strong>Mashrafe Mortaza</strong>, 85.5 mph, they've got another, Dhoni's got another!

He has previously hit Maxwell out of the attack with two sixes over midwicket, he tries a third one with a slog-sweep. Not quite to the pitch of the ball this time. Fatal. Top edge sits nicely with Finch at deep midwicket. Strange to see a rare hole-out by Misbah. That too at the short square boundary at Adelaide Oval.

Unfortunately for him, he has found out the one man stationed there. Aaron Finch hasn't had to move an inch. Akmal is disgusted with himself.

Samuels has upper-cut this, Vettori is stationed at the deep point/very square third man boundary, the ball seems like it will beat him, but he has executed the leap to perfection, and has pulled this off one-handed. This is a magic moment if ever there was one.He has jumped really high, and has taken it behind his body. They are throwing orange shorts at him from the crowd <strong>80/3</strong><br/>\n<strong>9.5</strong> to <strong>Ramdin</strong>, 88.3 mph, and he is now the leading wicket-taker this World Cup. The Cake Tin erupts again. Length ball, angling in, Ramdin has defended down the wrong line, the ball has hit him dead plumb. So plumb is this it almost rips the pad off his leg to actually try to hit the stumps.

Moving bowlers around has worked. Morkel bowls that awkward length with McCullum charging down the wicket. He is cramped for room as he swings. Doesn't time it at all, and fails to keep it down. Steyn, just taken out of the attack, takes it at mid-on <strong>71/1</strong><br/>\n<strong>8.5</strong> to <strong>Williamson</strong>, 85.2 mph, Morkel has turned this game around. He has taken two of New Zealand's best batsmen out. Morkel stays short, Williamson looks to pull, the shot is on, but the ball doesn't quite come on, and the bottom edge cannons into the stumps <strong>81/2</strong><br/>\n<strong>37.6</strong> to <strong>Anderson</strong>, 81.3 mph, Morkel has brought them back. Faf du Plesiss was never dropping this. South Africa roar. New Zealand slipping at the last hurdle? This has been a superb over by Morkel. Short of a length, around off, the ball gets big on him as he pulls. The top edge is massive. Kisses the moon before it comes back down. Du Plessis takes a lovely safe catch at square leg. Lets out a roar. But hold on. They are checking if this has kissed the spider cam wire on the way down. If it touches, we have a dead ball folks. The replays are inconclusive. In the dark sky with black cables it is hard to tell, and he is asked to walk on. What a farce it is that we have the spidercam. Encroaching upon the playing area. Has a farce been avoided narrowly? Conversation with the third umpire not relayed this time.

Dharmasena has gone to the third umpire with no soft signal this time. This is a slower legcutter, nearly a yorker, really really full. Taylor looks to drive, and the ball lobs to Haddin's right. The umpires check on both counts: bump ball and a clean catch. Replays show the ball has pitched just before hitting Taylor's bat, takes the outside edge, and the edge is soft, dying to Haddin's right. He flies to his right, takes a stunning one-handed catch.

That's why Australia were desperate to get him fit. He is a clutch player. Both with bat and ball. He has been asked to come back in the Powerplay, and he has taken out two wickets in three balls. Slower ball to get Taylor out, followed by a normal pace length ball, and then a quick yorker. Anderson is slow on this. Beaten for pace. He has squeezed it past the bat. Rushes away towards point after hitting the off stump. On replay, this is not quite a yorker, but a really full ball that kisses the pad and hits off stump. He has done him in for pace. Slower ball was 112ks, this was 133ks <strong>150/5</strong><br/>\n<strong>41.5</strong> to <strong>Elliott</strong>, 68.5 mph, Faulkner has brought that one final big wicket. Slower ball does it again. It is so hard to pick because it comes out with the seam up. Elliot sees a length ball that he can hit over the leg side, but he is way too early into the shot. He gets the outside edge, and Faulkner's back-of-the-hand slower ball always bounces extra, which means it carries to Haddin for yet another catch. Australia all over New Zealand.
